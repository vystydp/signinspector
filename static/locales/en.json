  "faq.heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq.bankidCompatible.question": "Is SignInspector compatible with BankID.cz?",
  "faq.bankidCompatible.answer": "Yes! SignInspector fully supports PDF signatures created with {bankid}. We validate the cryptographic signature, check document integrity, and verify the certificate against the EU Trusted List. BankID.cz uses qualified electronic signatures meeting EU eIDAS standards.",
  "faq.privacy.question": "Does my PDF leave my device?",
  "faq.privacy.answer": "{no} SignInspector runs entirely in your browser. Your PDF is processed locally using JavaScript and never uploaded to any server. This ensures complete privacy and makes it safe to validate sensitive documents like contracts, invoices, or legal papers.",
  "faq.privacy.no": "No.",
  "faq.modified.question": "What does \"Document modified after signing\" mean?",
  "faq.modified.answer": "This means the content of the PDF has changed since the digital signature was applied. The cryptographic hash no longer matches, indicating potential tampering or accidental modification. A valid signature on an unmodified document will show \"VERIFIED\" status.",
  "faq.formats.question": "What signature formats are supported?",
  "faq.formats.answer": "SignInspector supports standard PDF signatures including PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures), CMS/PKCS#7 signatures, BankID.cz signatures, EU qualified signatures (eIDAS), and most common PDF signature formats. We validate against the EU Trusted List for qualified trust service providers.",
  "faq.algorithms.question": "Which algorithms and regions are supported?",
  "faq.algorithms.answer": "Currently supports RSA and ECDSA-based signatures for EU/US standards. Support for Chinese SM2/SM3 and Russian GOST signatures is planned but not yet available.",
